# CheckQuest Backlog

**Backlog version:** 1.0  
**Established:** 2026-07-23  
**Current roadmap stage:** Stage 1 — Candidate-driven investigation

This file is the parking place for work that should not silently interrupt the current roadmap stage.

The canonical stage order is defined in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Status values

- **NOW** — belongs to the current roadmap stage.
- **QUEUED** — belongs to a later roadmap stage.
- **PARKED** — valid idea, but intentionally not scheduled yet.
- **DONE** — completed.
- **REJECTED** — explicitly not a goal unless circumstances change.

## Priority rule

Roadmap stage order is more important than backlog item number.

A newly added backlog item does **not** become immediate work merely because it sounds useful.

# Active and queued backlog

| ID | Item | Target stage | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| CQ-001 | Tie autonomous investigation actions directly to candidate findings | 1 | NOW | Actions should exist to gather evidence, not merely explore available UI. |
| CQ-002 | Prevent irrelevant investigation from consuming the investigation budget | 1 | NOW | Candidate relevance should gate autonomous investigation. |
| CQ-003 | Track novelty across the full run | 2 | QUEUED | Avoid repeatedly spending budget on equivalent content. |
| CQ-004 | Detect/represent page-type or template similarity | 2 | QUEUED | Near-identical pages should not receive equal exploration priority. |
| CQ-005 | Prefer unexplored page types and functional areas | 2 | QUEUED | Use limited page budgets for broader meaningful coverage. |
| CQ-006 | Pass known-finding context into later analysis | 3 | QUEUED | Gemini should know what has already been found. |
| CQ-007 | Prioritize new findings over rediscovery | 3 | QUEUED | Reduce duplicate findings across pages/steps. |
| CQ-008 | Allow useful evidence to strengthen an existing finding | 3 | QUEUED | Novel evidence should not be discarded just because the finding already exists. |
| CQ-009 | Expand the safe action vocabulary | 4 | QUEUED | Only after Stages 1–3 make action selection smarter. |
| CQ-010 | Define a unified finding model | 5 | QUEUED | Browser, model, and deterministic evidence should converge on one finding. |
| CQ-011 | Add explicit verification state to findings | 5 | QUEUED | Verified / Not Verified / Inconclusive or equivalent. |
| CQ-012 | Allow deterministic/static evidence to confirm or contradict model observations | 5 | QUEUED | Prevent unsupported model claims from being presented as confirmed defects. |
| CQ-013 | Improve complete inspection of the supplied start URL | 6 | QUEUED | Improve meaningful coverage without uncontrolled crawling. |
| CQ-014 | Improve navigation-depth and page-budget strategy | 6 | QUEUED | Spend exploration budget on higher-value routes. |
| CQ-015 | Avoid dead-end and low-value navigation routes | 6 | QUEUED | Navigation should serve coverage, not movement for its own sake. |
| CQ-016 | Add a separate passive security/infrastructure posture layer | 7 | QUEUED | Passive only; CheckQuest is not a penetration-testing tool. |
| CQ-017 | Review large files and responsibility boundaries | 8 | QUEUED | DevAnalyzer takeaway; refactor only where it materially improves the codebase. |
| CQ-018 | Add/strengthen ESLint and static-quality checks | 8 | QUEUED | Include appropriate CI enforcement. |
| CQ-019 | Expand unit/integration test depth around agent logic | 8 | QUEUED | Candidate handling, schemas, novelty, context, dedupe, verification, decision logic. |
| CQ-020 | Harden error handling, retries, and observability | 8 | QUEUED | Include model, browser, configuration, logging, and progress failures. |
| CQ-021 | Expand setup and architecture documentation | 8 | QUEUED | Document the architecture after it stabilizes rather than continuously rewriting it. |
| CQ-022 | Perform a repository-wide production-readiness/CI review | 8 | QUEUED | Deliberate hardening pass rather than analyzer-score chasing. |
| CQ-023 | Formalize presentation-agnostic core boundaries | 9 | QUEUED | Keep CLI, desktop, and web/SaaS options viable. |
| CQ-024 | Formalize Gemini BYOK handling across future interfaces | 9 | QUEUED | User keys must remain user-owned, isolated, and unlogged. |
| CQ-025 | Define release-quality installation/distribution | 10 | QUEUED | Exact mechanism depends on product direction. |
| CQ-026 | Finalize stable configuration/versioning/report behavior | 10 | QUEUED | Required before external users depend on CheckQuest. |
| CQ-027 | Polish the public repository and example/demo configuration | 10 | QUEUED | Final external-facing repository pass. |

# Parking lot

These are valid future possibilities, but they are **not commitments to build them now**.

| ID | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CQ-P001 | Windows/Desktop UI | PARKED | Architecture should permit it; implementation waits until the core/product direction is mature. |
| CQ-P002 | Web/SaaS frontend | PARKED | Architecture should permit it; no decision yet between desktop, SaaS, or both. |

# Explicit non-goals / rejected score-chasing

These may be reconsidered later if a genuine product or deployment requirement appears.

| ID | Item | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| CQ-R001 | Add Docker solely because an analyzer expects containerization | REJECTED | Containerization should solve a deployment problem, not improve a score. |
| CQ-R002 | Add a standalone build command solely because an analyzer expects one | REJECTED | Add a build/package step only when runtime or distribution requires it. |
| CQ-R003 | Broaden the technology stack merely to improve “stack breadth” | REJECTED | CheckQuest should use the technologies it needs, not collect technologies. |

# Adding a new backlog item

When a new issue or idea appears:

1. Decide whether it is a **BLOCKER**, **DEFECT**, or **BACKLOG** item.
2. If it is not a blocker, add it here before doing implementation work.
3. Assign the most appropriate roadmap stage when possible.
4. Use **PARKED** when the idea is valid but does not yet belong to a committed stage.
5. Do not reorder roadmap stages silently.
6. Mark items **DONE** as part of stage completion.

Suggested ID format:

- `CQ-###` — scheduled roadmap backlog item.
- `CQ-P###` — parked future idea.
- `CQ-R###` — rejected/non-goal unless circumstances change.
